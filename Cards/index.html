                  <p>Now the third little Pig met a Man with a load of bricks, and said, “Please, sir, give me those bricks to build a house with”; so the Man gave him the bricks, and he built his house with them.

                    So the Wolf came, as he did to the other little Pigs, and said, “Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in.”
                    
                    “Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin!”
                    
                    “Then I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in.”Well, he huffed and he puffed, and he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and he huffed; but he could not get the house to fall down. When he found that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the house down, he said, “Little Pig, I know where there is a nice field of turnips.”</p>

              <p>“Where?” said the little Pig.

                “Oh, in Mr. Smith's home-field; and if you'll be ready tomorrow morning, I will call for you, and we will go together and get some for dinner.”
                
                “Very well,” said the little Pig, “I will be ready. What time do you mean to go?”
                
                “Oh, at six o'clock.”
                
                Well, the little Pig got up at five, and went and found the field, got the turnips and was home again before six. When the Wolf came he said, “Little Pig, are you ready?”
                
                “Ready!” said the little Pig, “I have already been to the field and come back again, and I got myself a nice pot-full of turnips for dinner.”</p>

              <p>When he heard this, the Wolf felt very angry…but he thought he could outsmart the little Pig somehow or other; so he said, “Little Pig, I know where there is a nice apple-tree.”

                “Where?” said the Pig.“Down at Merry-garden,” replied the Wolf; “and if you will not deceive me I will come for you, at five o’clock tomorrow, and we will go together and get some apples.”
                
                Well, the little Pig woke at four the next morning, and got up in hurry, and went off for the apples, hoping to get back before the Wolf came. But he had farther to go, and he had to climb the tree…so that, just as he was coming down from it, he saw the Wolf coming (which, as you may suppose, frightened him very much). When the Wolf came up he said, “Little Pig! What…are you here before me once again? Are they nice apples?”

                Then the little Pig said, “Haha! I frightened you, did I? I had been to the Fair and bought a butter churn, and when I saw you I got into it, and rolled down the hill.”
                Then the Wolf was very angry indeed, and he declared that he would eat up the little Pig, and that, in fact…right now…he was going to come down the chimney after him!

And the little Pig put the cover back on again in an instant, boiled him up, ate him for supper, and lived happy ever after.
