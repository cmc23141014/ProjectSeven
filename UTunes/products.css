CBT -
-Take care of yourself
-Be present / practice mindfullness
-Face your fears head on -Just Do It!
-Bring joy into your life / do things you enjoy / be with people you enjoy and people who enjoy you
and uplift and care about you.  
-Think helpful thoughts
-Seth J. Gillihan - Retrain your brain workbook -seven week
-mindfullness can improve your physical, mental, and probably your spiritual health
-Thinking that if I could know that if I really did have the dream Jackie and Dad told me I had, that would
help me to know if Heavenly Father does speak to me through dreams because I have had a lot of nightmares over
the past couple years.  But if I didn't have the dream, and they just made it up, it would confirm the same truth
either way.  So I don't really need to know if I had that dream or not.  
-What makes me happy?
   -Playing the piano
   -Being around uplifting, fun people who care about and want the best for me -people who want to help me
   -Serving others -having the opportunity to do so
   -Playing the clarinet
   -Being free -being able to move forward and upward and make my own decisions for my life
   -Being around animals
   -Crafts
   -Being outside
   -Playing sports
-Exposure Therapy
-Get rid of stress
-Relaxation therapy
-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1cpb0tYV74&list=PL6QREj8te1P6wX9m5KnicnDVEucbOPsqR&index=8
-Acceptance allows us to react appropriately to the facts in front of us.  He gives the example of his
boss and him needing to move on rather than live in denial / apathy or anger.  
-Many of the problems he listed that mindfulness helps with are problems that I have / have had since I 
was a little girl.  I didn't have those problems while I was happier / things were going much better in 
my life.   
-People can be trained in Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy ( MBCT )
-Acceptance and commitment therapy ( ACT )
-Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction ( MBSR )
-Acceptance Based Behavioral Therapy
-Mindfulness is accepting reality and not denying it.  Letting go is hard work.  
-Procrastination is often the result of believing that we will fail at something -fear of not doing a good
job or failing.  Fear of not being able to control a situation.  Negative reinforcement vs. positive reinforcement.
When we procrastinate we are getting negative reinforcement.  When we push through a task that we fear doing we get 
positive reinforcement.  Perfectionism leads to procrastination.  Dr. Gillihan and Dr. R have both said
don't try to be perfect, settle for good enough in your work and other things.  
-Think Act Be for procrastination
-Completing tasks makes us healthier both spritually, mentally, and physicallybecause we don't have 
the stress that procrastination brings.  We also become more confident when we complete and push through
challenging tasks.

-Sunday
Lori came to get me for church -talked to her about her cat, she asked if I thought I would get an animal,
talked abbout FOHA, trying to foster an animal / my parents have a dog - said my mother and I are not
close.  She said she grew up all over the place.  She said she does meal prep on Sunday.  I said Dad is 
a good cook and helps me do that sometimes.  
Had a feeling I should start getting ready earlier than I normally would have and I know Heavenly
Father must have prompted me because I got ready just in time.  I don't know what I was thinking - 
I completely lost track of time.
